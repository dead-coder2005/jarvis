# fuck

you explain your project here lol

so, heres what I have done

 - added some ease of convenience when you install packages,
   - run `python3 -m pipreqs . --force` to convert packages to easy file.
   - run `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to download packages.
   - i think you can remove the `python3 -m` part idk how you have `pip` installed.
   - fixed up some commands.
